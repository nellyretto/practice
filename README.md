# What are Binary Trees?

Binary Trees defines as a hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children, which are known as left child and right child.

*Parent nodes:* refers to the node has two or more subordinated nodes connected to it.

*Children nodes:* refers to the nodes that are directly connected and subordinated to another node, knows as teh parent node.
