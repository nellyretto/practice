# Sorting algorithms & Big O

This repository is a group project for the Big O algortihms. This project intends for us to be able to understand and explain this algorithms by ourselves.

# What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmannâ€“Landau notation or asymptotic notation

## Algorithms implemented

## Bubble sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

In **Bubble Sort** algorithm
*traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side.
*In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first.
*This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.
