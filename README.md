Project Overview

This repository contains a group project with C language on Binary Trees. 


All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

```c
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
```

### Betty coding style:

All files are written in C and follows the Betty coding style for Holberton School. For more detail, check this page:

# What are Binary Trees?

Binary Trees defines as a hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children, which are known as left child and right child.

*Parent nodes:* refers to the node has two or more subordinated nodes connected to it.

*Children nodes:* refers to the nodes that are directly connected and subordinated to another node, knows as teh parent node.

## Project Overview

`0. New node`
**Write a function that creates a binary tree node**
```c
binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value)
```

`1. Insert left`
Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

`2. Insert right`
Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

`3. Delete`
Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree

`4. Is leaf`
Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf

`5. Is root`
Write a function that checks if a given node is a root

`6. Pre-order traversal`
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

`7. In-order traversal`
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

`8. Post-order traversal`
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal

`9. Height`
Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree

`10. Depth`
Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree

`11. Size`
Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree

`12. Leaves`
Write a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree

`13. Nodes`
